# README

Bindgen bash scripts and configuration files.

See `.github/workflows/bindgen.yml` in the root of the repository for execution.

It is assumed that `ext/build-native-libraries.sh` is executed to create the include directories.

See [c2cs Git repository](https://github.com/bottlenoselabs/c2cs) for more info on how this all works.

## Logging

Change `appsettings.json` to configure logging for `c2ffi` and `c2cs`.
